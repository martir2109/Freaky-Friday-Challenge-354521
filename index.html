WHAT THE WEBSITE SHOULD HAVE:

I would like a website about the Maldives. I want it to encourage people to travel to the Maldives. I would like a modern website, targeted towards young adults. I would like photos in the front, which you can clearly see when you open the website. I was thinking the color scheme should be blue, brown and white, but I’m open to suggestions.

 After tourism, fishing is the most important industry; most tuna is fished, which is exported both fresh and canned. Only 13 percent of the land area is arable; sweet potatoes and millet are grown, among other things. The population is largely dependent on food imports.
